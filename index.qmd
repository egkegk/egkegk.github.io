Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a postgraduate student at Imperial College London studying towards an MSc Statistics. I graduated from Pomona College in Spring 2025 with majors in [Mathematics](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics-statistics) (with distinction) and [Spanish](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/romance-languages-literatures).

I am passionate about transforming data into communicative, actionable analyses. My experience in mathematics research provides a foundation for analyzing all types of data, while my background in languages propels my desire to communicate data effectively. I am happiest with my work when complex analysis is blended with beautiful visualizations.
