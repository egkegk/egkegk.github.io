Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a postgraduate student at Imperial College London studying towards an MSc Statistics. I received my Bachelor's of Arts from [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/about) in Claremont, California, with majors in Mathematics (Statistics) and Spanish.

I am passionate about transforming data into communicative, actionable analyses. My experience in mathematics research provides a foundation for analyzing all types of data, while my background in languages propels my desire to communicate data effectively. I am happiest with my work when complex analysis is blended with beautiful visualizations.
