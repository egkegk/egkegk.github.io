I was a member of the 2023 Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, under the mentorship of [Ryan Moruzzi, Jr.](https://www.ryanmoruzzi.com/) and [Michael Young](https://www.cmu.edu/math/people/faculty/young.html). My group studied a novel variant of zero forcing. Our poster was accepted for presentation at the 2023 National Diversity in STEM (NDiSTEM)/SACNAS Conference, where it received an award for Excellence in Undergraduate Mathematics Poster Presentation, and at the 2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) in San Francisco. I was a presenting author at both conferences.

The results of our research have since been published in *Involve: A Journal of Mathematics*. The journal copy of our paper is available [here](https://doi.org/10.2140/involve.2025.18.719), and an arXiv preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10154).
