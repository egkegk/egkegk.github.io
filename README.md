This is the repository for my Github Pages website.

To make this website, I first looked at a lot of websites made by people I admire.
I took notes on what I thought worked aesthetically, and what didn't. Some of these websites did very different things,
and stored various amounts of information. I decided I wanted a simple site to show off projects I'm working on.

Since I'm a statistician and work mainly in R/Python, I decided to make my website through Quarto, as Quarto
allows for easy porting between projects and easy construction of a website from rendered html files. I used
the [official guide to Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) as my main guide (there is also
[Quarto: The Definitive Guide](https://quarto-tdg.org/websites), but I did not refer to this while making this site),
and [this slideshow from UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide)
to learn how to customize my website's theme. Every other trick was learned through a lot of precise Googling.
